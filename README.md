## My name is staticalliam7, and I'm cool.
## I play lots of Mindustry, Portal/Portal 2, Minecraft, and Kerbal Space Program. 
I am learning Rust, Python, and Nim. I know basic JavaScript but I am too lazy to actually learn it, so it's restricted to basically Discord.js. I already have a solid understanding of C# and Java. I want to mod Simplerockets 2, but it is absolute hell trying to stuggle with SR2 modtools

Check out the mindustry mod, and try to help out

also the stuff down here breaks a lot. oh well what are ya gonna do `¯\_(ツ)_/¯ `
