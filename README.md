# Hi! I'm staticalliam7, a self taught coder and spaceflight enthusiast
## I play lots of Mindustry, Portal/Portal 2, Minecraft, and Kerbal Space Program. 
I am also into robotics. I am working on the [GlaDOS Project](https://github.com/theGlaDOSProject)
I am learning Rust, Python, and Nim. I know basic JavaScript but I am too lazy to actually learn it, so it's restricted to basically Discord.js. I already have a solid understanding of C# and Java. I want to mod Simplerockets 2, but it is absolute hell trying to stuggle with SR2 modtools
